    content="Vince Staples was met with critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 86, based on 9 reviews.[4] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave the album four stars out of five. He opined that the album's 'spectral take on his region’s G-funk, paired with conversational lyrics, deepens his outsider appeal'.[15] Kyann-Sian Williams of NME also gave the album four starts out of five, stating 'The Long Beach rapper pairs playful one-liners with smouldering beats on his fourth full-length'.[16] Paste Magazine’s Matt Mitchell gave the album an 8.2 out of 10, citing that the foundation of Staples’ success “starts in the basement of survival, while other rappers punctuate their ladder-climbing with long bars about seven-figure houses, island getaways and private jets.” [17]" />

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
